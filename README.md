KissingTurtles is a collaborative game for 2 players. Emily the little pig wants to  meet Franklin to kiss :)
Helps Emily/Franklin to move the tyrtle/pig around the maze. You will need to use a langgue to give instructions. 
DSL (Domain Specific Language) is:

move up by 2

General Idea
============

1. DSL to move the turtle/robot is written in Groovy

2. Grails for Server side Controller part that will do shell.evaluate and return position value for the turtle. 

3. HTML5 Canvas API for displaying turtle move and position. We can make it more complex with walls. See little drawing.

4. html5-mobile-scaffolding for the UI. No GSP, only HTML and JS. http://3musket33rs.github.com/ To go further if time permit:

5. push notification: multi players joining a virtual room.

Where's it all started 
================
Grails48 in November 2012, it's over but we had great fun!!!
