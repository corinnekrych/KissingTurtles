General Idea
============

1. DSL to move the turtle/robot is written in Groovy

2. Grails for Server side Controller part that will do shell.evaluate and return position value for the turtle. 
See code done for DSL presentation Sebi and I did at GR8Conf

* https://github.com/corinnekrych/dsl 

3. HTML5 Canvas API for displaying turtle move and position. We can make it more complex with walls. See little drawing.

4. html5-mobile-scaffolding for the UI. No GSP, only HTML and JS. http://3musket33rs.github.com/ To go further if time permit:

5. push/ pooling notification: multi players joining a virtual room.

How to organize ourself
=======================

* use of github issues
